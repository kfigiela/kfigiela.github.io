title: Using native OS X NAT with VirtualBox
---

VirtualBox provides built-in NAT, but on OS X it doesn't allow to access VM from host, so every time I need to set up host only network. I wanted to have one, fully functional virtual network with NAT routing. OS X has built-in NAT capability that is used by Internet Sharing â€“ why not use it with VirtualBox?

**Note:** This post is work-in-progress.

### VirtualBox configuration

First of all we need to configure host-only network in VirtualBox. I arbitrary choose `10.0.69.0/24` network for purpose of this tutorial. I configured host-only network `vboxnet0` to use this network. Remember to disable VirtualBox DHCP server, as it doesn't allow to provide gateway address.

### OS X NAT configuration

First, we need to enable routing capability in OS X network stack. Run `sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1` or add

```
net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
```

to `/etc/sysctl.conf` (create this file if necessary) to make this persist over reboots.

Then add the following NAT rules to `/etc/pf.conf`:

```
nat on en0 proto {tcp, udp, icmp} from 10.0.69.0/24 to any -> (en0)
nat on en1 proto {tcp, udp, icmp} from 10.0.69.0/24 to any -> (en1)
pass from {lo0, 10.0.69.0/24} to any keep state
```

On my Mac `en0` is Gigabit Ethernet and `en1` is AirPort. That way NAT will work regardless of what is my current internet connection. You may need to adjust it depending on your configuration.

To load new rules run `sudo pfctl -e -f /etc/pf.conf` and to ensure that rules are loaded on each boot run:

```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'add :ProgramArguments:3 string -e' /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.pfctl.plist
```

### DHCP configuration

You probably also want to have We may want to use OS X built-in DHCP server. First of all, you'll need to create `/etc/bootpd.plist` file that setups DHCP server for `10.0.69.0/24` network with dynamic range of `10.0.69.50-254` and providing public DNS server (`8.8.8.8`) to clients:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>bootp_enabled</key>
    <false/>
    <key>detect_other_dhcp_server</key>
    <integer>1</integer>
    <key>dhcp_enabled</key>
    <array>
        <string>vboxnet0</string>
    </array>
    <key>reply_threshold_seconds</key>
    <integer>0</integer>
    <key>Subnets</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>allocate</key>
            <true/>
            <key>lease_max</key>
            <integer>86400</integer>
            <key>lease_min</key>
            <integer>86400</integer>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>10.0.69</string>
            <key>net_address</key>
            <string>10.0.69.0</string>
            <key>net_mask</key>
            <string>255.255.255.0</string>
            <key>net_range</key>
            <array>
                <string>10.0.69.50</string>
                <string>10.0.69.254</string>
            </array>
            <key>dhcp_domain_name_server</key>
            <array>
                <string>8.8.8.8</string>
            </array>            
        </dict>
    </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then you may enable `bootpd` with `sudo /bin/launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/bootps.plist`. To disable just replace `load` with `unload` in the command.

### Add host-only network to VMs

This should be quite straightforward, simply add host-only network to your VMs and run DHCP client or set static ip from chosen network

### Set static MAC-based DHCP IP addresses (optional)

Create `/etc/bootpstab` file, here is an example of the content:

```
#
# bootptab example
#
%%
# machine entries have the following format:
#
# hostname      hwtype  hwaddr              ipaddr          bootfile
client1         1       00:01:02:03:04:05   10.0.0.20       
client2         1       00:a0:b2:ef:ff:0a   10.0.0.20       
``
