Here I release a homebrew app to replace now unsupported SaffireControl LE app. The app supports Focusrite Saffire LE interface (does not support original Saffire) and works on macOS Catalina. It allows for a little bit more than the original (computer channels may be used both as stereo or double mono).

Download the app from [GitHub](https://github.com/kfigiela/saffire-mixer-ui/releases). Should you find any issues, please report them on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kfigiela/saffire-mixer-ui/issues).

**Update #1 (2020-11-23)** Good news! macOS Big Sur supports firewire audio and Focusrite Saffire LE. The app also works!
